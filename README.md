#remove this file
sudo rm -f /zerofill

```
## shutdown the virtual machine 
```sh
shutdown now
```

## login to the esxi server as root

```sh
cd /vmfs/volumes/[YOUR STORAGE NAME]/[YOUR VM MACHINE NAME]

vmkfstools -K your-vmdk-file.vmdk
# until you see Hole Punching: 100% done.

# Because the new space will not always appears, the following commands will be better than restarting the whole server
/etc/init.d/hostd restart
/etc/init.d/vpxa restart
```
